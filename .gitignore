# Note: In some GitHub Action patterns, dist/ IS committed. 
# But usually, it's better to keep it ignored and use a release workflow to commit it if needed,
# or commit it if that's the project's convention. 
# Given T030, we are building it. I'll leave it out of gitignore for now if we want to commit it.
# Actually, the convention for many actions IS to commit dist. 
# I'll ignore node_modules and other junk.
